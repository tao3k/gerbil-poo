# Gerbil-POO

Gerbil-POO is an implementation of Prototype Object Orientation for Gerbil.
This object model is directly inspired by that of Nix, isomorphic to that of Jsonnet.

### HACKING

If you'd like to build your own object system, with its own optimized meta-object protocol
to implement objects efficiently, come join the team!

See the [doc/TODO.md](doc/TODO.md) document for projects.

### Structural value contracts

[`object-contract`](doc/object-contracts.md) adds structural responsibilities and
diagnostics over existing POO Types, with optional prototype requirements and
reuse of the existing checked invocation Contract. It is independent of any
configuration framework; Schema adapters remain separate libraries.

### Finite cyclic construction

[`closure`](doc/closure.md) provides positive Boolean closure with private compiled
metadata, owned byte state, allocation-aware queue selection, immutable public
snapshots, retained-topology revisions, POO workflow controls and Scheme benchmarks.
This advances generalized-prototype future work with a bounded Lean cost-model
companion; it does not change ordinary prototype recursion.

### Scheme CI

Use `gerbil build`, `gerbil clean` and `gerbil test`. Each `build.ss` declares its
inputs with `defbuild-script`; `std/make` owns dependency order, timestamps,
compilation and artifact reuse. There is no additional source scanner, hash
ledger, manifest parser, copied source view or test runner.

`just build` prepares the root library package, the benchmark executable package

See [test execution](doc/test-execution.md) and [CI checks](doc/ci-checks.md).

Standalone executables use `pkg-config --libs openssl` through `std/make`.
Configure the toolchain’s standard pkg-config search path for your installation;
no platform-specific OpenSSL prefix is embedded.
